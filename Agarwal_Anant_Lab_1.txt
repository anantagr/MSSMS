Question 1. 
For each invoice that has PaymentDate (not null), calculate and display how many days before the due date the invoice was paid. 
More specifically, display invoiceID, invoice number, invoice date, invoice due date, payment date, and calculated column that 
is the number of days from payment date to due date (this column should have positive values where invoice was paid before due date, 
and negative if it was paid after due date).
Display all date values without time component. Make sure all columns have meaningful headers.

Answer 1.

select InvoiceID, InvoiceNumber, 
	convert (date, InvoiceDate) as InvoiceDate,
	convert (date, InvoiceDueDate) as InvoiceDueDate,
	convert (date, PaymentDate) as PaymentDate,
	datediff(day, PaymentDate, InvoiceDueDate) as NumberOfDaysBeforeDueDate
from Invoices
where PaymentDate IS NOT NULL




Question 2.
Using InvoiceLineItems, display invoice ids together with how many lines each invoice has. Include only invoices that have more 
than one line. Make sure all columns have meaningful headers.

Answer 2.

select InvoiceID,
	count(InvoiceSequence) as NumberOfLinesInInvoice
from InvoiceLineItems
Group By InvoiceID
Having count(InvoiceSequence) > 1




Question 3.
Add InvoiceNumber and VendorName to the previous query (you will need to join two more tables).

Answer 3.

Select InvoiceLineItems.InvoiceID, InvoiceNumber, Vendors.VendorName,
	count(InvoiceSequence) as NumberOfLinesInInvoice
From ((Invoices 
	join InvoiceLineItems on InvoiceLineItems.InvoiceID = Invoices.InvoiceID)
	join Vendors on Vendors.VendorID = Invoices.VendorID)
Group By InvoiceLineItems.InvoiceID, Invoices.InvoiceNumber, Vendors.VendorName
Having count(InvoiceSequence) > 1




Question 4.
Display account numbers and descriptions of all accounts from GLAccounts table that are NOT referenced by any invoice line item.

Answer 4.

Select GLAccounts.AccountNo, AccountDescription 
From GLAccounts
	Left join InvoiceLineItems on GLAccounts.AccountNo = InvoiceLineItems.AccountNo
where InvoiceLineItems.AccountNo is null




Question 5.
or each vendor who has invoices display vendor ID, vendor name and the date of the most recent invoice of that vendor. 
Display all date values without time component. Make sure all columns have meaningful headers.

Answer 5.

Select Vendors.VendorID, VendorName, 
convert (date, MAX(Invoices.InvoiceDate)) as "Most Recent InvoiceDate"
From Vendors
	Inner join Invoices on Vendors.VendorID = Invoices.VendorID
Group by Vendors.VendorID, VendorName
